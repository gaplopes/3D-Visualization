# 3D-Visualization of Non-dominated Solutions with Plotly

This repository contains a 3D visualization plot created using Plotly to visualize the area of non-dominated solutions in a 3D space taking into account the reference points dominated by the solutions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone
```

2. Open the file `3D-Visualization.html` in your browser to see the visualization.

---------------------

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `3D-Visualization.html`: The visualization plot created using Plotly.
- `scripts/`: Contains the scripts used to generate the data for the visualization.
- `style/`: Contains the CSS style for the visualization.

---------------------

## Plot Description

The plot shows the area of non-dominated solutions in a 3D space taking into account the reference points dominated by the solutions.

The solutions are represented by the points in the plot and the area of non-dominated solutions is represented by the colored area and shown in the table below the header "Solution Points".

The reference points available to add new solutions are shown in the table below the header "Reference Points".

The plot is interactive and allows the user to rotate the plot and zoom in and out.

---------------------

## Usage

To add a new solution to the plot, enter the solution's objectives values in the text boxes and click the `Add Solution` button.

The solution will be added to the plot and the area of non-dominated solutions will be updated.

To remove a solution from the plot, click the `Remove Solution` button. The last solution added will be removed.
